My exercises and (extended) examples from the book 
["*Real World Haskell*"](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)
by Bryan O'Sullivan, John Goerzen and Don Stewart

The original examples can be downloaded e.g. from [the book's page
on O'Reilly's web site](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596514983.do)
I only place here examples for which I created variations, extensions
and otherwise played with.
